                        <p>Kickstarter website was performed with a minimalistic style which seems clean and simple, but it also found some usability and accessibility issues. First of all, obvious issue that has been found is Tab Index. It seems to work perfectly on Firefox Quantum, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge , which is ordering from top to bottom of the page and shows outstanding stylesheet of the selected object. Unless on Safari, Tab Index was not working, it is unable to detect the element on the page.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, ten buttons without value and three dropdown buttons that were missing labels were found by WAVE tool.

The label of each form is supposed to appear properly in order to give users the information regarding forms and fields.

                        <p>In addition, the colour contrast of text and background did not meet the expectation of WCAG contrast ratio standard that is 4.5:1. For example, text colour of menu lists was too light on the white background which has colour contrast ratio only 2.69 (font colour: #9b9e9e; background colour: #ffffff). This is also shown on the About Us page, white texts on the bright background and video background. These low colour contrast contents would be a problem of people who have a colour vision deficiency or colour blindness, as well as people with old ages who might have low vision condition. Hence, they will find it difficult to read these texts, and may be unable to see it appearing on the page.</p>

                        <p>Moreover, some images are missing alternative text where screen reader users will miss the existing of the image.

                        <p>Nevertheless, there are assistant applications that help increase user accessibility. The Mouse Keys (macOS’s built-in accessibility tool) will help users with a keyboard who are able to access Kickstarter website on safari and are experiencing the Tab Index issue. With Mouse Keys, the user can control their cursor by numeric keypad. ATbar (atbar.org) is a free tool for assist users increase their accessibility on any website. This tool has a simple interface which is able to understand it in a short time, lightweight, and compatibility with all browsers. It comes with text reader features that users can use when screen reader programs are not working on any browser, like Firefox Quantum with VoiceOver. As well as, adjustability font size, font colour, and background colour features are available for use if users find that the font size is too small or too difficult to read due to the colour contrast. However, some issues that need to solve in HTML itself are still existing, such as the missing value in buttons, improper alternative text of images, labels of form, and lack of capture and description of videos. Besides, those empty links, such as social media links, can be solved by adding aria-label into anchor tag (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>).</p>
